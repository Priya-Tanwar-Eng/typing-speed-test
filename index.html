            The Patronus is the most famous defensive charm. The aim is to
            produce a protector, which takes the form of an animal. The exact
            form of the Patronus will not be apparent until the spell has been
            successfully cast. It is the only spell effective against Dementors.
            The majority of witches and wizards are unable to produce Patronuses
            and to do so is generally considered a mark of superior magical
            ability.

            They can develop under a variety of conditions within these climatic
            limits, and the kind of soil, plant, and animal life differs
            according to the extremes of environmental influences. In cool,
            high-latitude subpolar regions, forests are dominated by hardy
            conifers like pines, spruces, and larches. A growing period of 100
            to 200 days allows deciduous forests to be dominated by oaks, elms,
            birches, maples, beeches, and aspens.

            I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so
            that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate
            them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to
            trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so
            better things can fall together.

            Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things
            that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the
            bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in
            your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.

            I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am
            out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle
            me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.
